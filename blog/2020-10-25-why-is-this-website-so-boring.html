        <h3>why is this website so boring?</h3>
        So, if you haven't noticed, this website is boring in comparison to other websites. I'd like to talk about why as to hopefully shed some light on the current state of our internet.</br></br>

        To start off, this website doesn't use any JavaScript. Not that js is bad, but without it, the user can know that I'm not running any ridiculous tracking/analytics software or, in other words, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-free code</a>. Matter of fact, <a href="https://github.com/johnmahlon/johnmahlon.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can view the source code for this website.</a></br></br>

        Secondly, I've been spending time exploring websites served over different protocls like <a href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gopher</a>. These are text-based websites that bring back the simplicity of the early internet. I hope to use HTML/CSS as a more modern version of what these protocols offer, and I plan to offer exclusive blog posts over Gemini in the future as well.</br></br>

        Last, but not least -- ok, least -- I really have no interest in a fancy or 'beautiful' front-end interface. I hope to get my content out and I hope whoever reads it finds it interesting without all the flashing lights and fancy JavaScript.</br></br>

        On that note, welcome to my website & blog!</br></br>

        - john
